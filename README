Problem 1:
ValueIteration.py has the value iteration for the maze.

Problem 2:
qLearning.py has the entire qLearning problem for the maze

Problem 3:
acrobat.py has the REINFORCE algorithm called REINFORCEAcrobat() as well as the qlearning algorithm called qLearningAcrobat().
For the qLearningAcrobat, we use the evaluationAcrobat.py. To run qLearning,
just run that method in the if __name__ == "__main__" of the file and vice versa for REINFORCECar().

(d): We cannot use PI/VI since we only have a sequence of state, action, reward triplets but we don't have a full
transition and reward matrix per se.

Problem 4:
car.py has functions qLearningMountain() to do the qLearning and also REINFORCECar() to do the REINFORCE. To run qLearning,
just run that method in the if __name__ == "__main__" of the file and vice versa for REINFORCECar().
This problem uses evaluationCar.py to do evaluation.
