Problem 1:
ValueIteration.py has the value iteration

Problem 2:
qLearning.py has the entire q learning problem

Problem 3:
(d): We cannot use PI/VI since we only have a sequence of state, action, reward triplets but we don't have a full
transition and reward matrix per se.

Problem 4:
car.py has functions qLearningMountain to do the qLearning and also REINFORCEMountain to do the REINFORCE
